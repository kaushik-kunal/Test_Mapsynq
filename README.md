# Test_Mapsynq
This repository holds a custom Test Automation framework build to test the Mapsynq web app

This framework is based on Behavior Driven Development Approach


Below are the key elements and foundation details of thi framework:
1. POM is implemented in complete essence, suing Page Factories to maintain elements. This is kept in a folder named Pages
2. There is a feature folder holding Test case/Scenario in it
3. The Glue code behind can be find in Step Folder, which contains class files where functionality behind Feature is implemented
4. The tests are containerized using chrome docker image. For now I have used it in my localhost to achieve this
5. The reporting is done using Extent Reports
